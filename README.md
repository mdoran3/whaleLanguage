# whaleLanguage
Convert any string into a whale's language.

This is a simple program thats asks the user for input and then
converts that input into a fictional whale language. The input
string is iterated through by nested for loops. Nested for 
loops are not necessarily good in terms of asymptotic
time complexity, but for the sake of this program we are 
assuming that not very large inputs will be applied at any
given time. 

Compile commane: g++ whale.cpp

Execution: ./a.out
